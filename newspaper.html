							<article>
								Embattled Australian cricketers Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft have been given the final sanctions by Cricket Australia CEO James Sutherland, and the trio are set to be out of cricketing action for quite a lengthy time. While Warner and Smith have been handed a 1 year ban, Bancroft will be out for 9 months. The ban also prevents them from playing in the Indian Premier League, meaning their franchises will have to find appropriate replacements in such a short period of time.
							</article><br>
							<article>Sutherland, in his press conference on Tuesday, had said that the final punishments for the trio will justify the depth of their acts and before the decision was made official, reports of Smith and Warner being given a 12-month ban had surfaced.</article><br>
							<article>Vice-captain Warner, along with Australian skipper Steve Smith and opener Cameron Bancroft, are in the line of fire due to the scandal that broke out during the third Test against South Africa in Cape Town. Bancroft was caught on camera while using a yellow tape to tamper the ball.</article>

			<article>
				After admitting to ball-tampering during Australia’s loss to South Africa in the Cape Town Test, Steve Smith has stepped down from his position as captain of Indian Premier League (IPL) franchise Rajasthan Royals. India batsman Ajinkya Rahane will be replacing the Aussie skipper in the role for the IPL 2018 season.
			</article>
			<article>The development has taken place a couple of days after Smith and teammate Cameron Bancroft sensationally admitted to having tampered the ball on Day 3 of the third Test against the Proteas.</article>

						On the way down, the index has broken a number of crucial supports, latest being the psychological mark of 10,000.

				<article >Before you jump to any conclusion, I am talking about his characters in films and not Salman Khan, the person. Now coming to the point as to why I say so. Well, last night after the six character posters, the first full family look of Race 3 was released. The poster had Salman Khan, Anil Kapoor, Bobby Deol, Jacqueline Fernandez, Saqib Saleem and Daisy Shah. All of them looked extremely stylish and I was sold for the film, more so because it had an interesting tag line which stated, "You Don't Need Enemies When You Have A Family".

				<figcaption>Sara Ali Khan in a still from Kedarnath<br> </figcaption>
							
				<article>It was in June last year that Kapoor decided to give Sara her big ticket to Bollywood, but his fallout with producer Prernaa Arora played a spoiler. Weeks after the row, the film's fate still seems to be hanging by a delicate thread.

		For the longest time there were rumours of Sara making her debut with a KJo film, but Abhishek Kapoor surprised everyone by announcing his film with Sara. Now with Kedarnath in troubled waters, KJo has taken Sara under his wings.

		It was last week that KJo made the announcement that Sara will romance Ranveer Singh in Simmba.

		Now a report in Mumbai Mirror suggests that the release date of Kedarnath has been pushed to mid-January 2019. With Simmba slated for December 28 release, Sara will now make her Bollywood debut with Shetty's film.</article>>
